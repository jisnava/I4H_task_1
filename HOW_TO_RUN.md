# How to Run Your App on Mobile

## 1. Install Live Server (One-time setup)
"Live Server" is not a separate program. It is a free tool **inside** VS Code.

1.  Open **VS Code**.
2.  Look at the **Left Sidebar**. You will see icons for Files, Search, Source Control, etc.
3.  Click the **Extensions** icon (It looks like 4 squares, with one square flying away).
4.  In the search box at the top, type: `Live Server`
5.  Click on the first result (created by *Ritwick Dey*).
6.  Click the blue **Install** button.

## 2. Run the App
1.  Go back to your **Files** (Top icon on the left sidebar).
2.  Right-click on the file named `index.html`.
3.  Select **"Open with Live Server"** from the menu.
4.  A browser window will pop up on your computer with your app.

## 3. Connect with Mobile
1.  Look at the address bar in that new browser window.
    *   It usually says: `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`
    *   The number `5500` is your **Port**.
2.  Take your phone and ensure it is connected to **"nitk.ac.in"** (same Wi-Fi as your PC).
3.  Open Chrome or Safari on your phone.
4.  Type this exact address (replace `5500` if your port is different):
    
    `http://10.100.38.63:5500`

5.  Your app should appear!
